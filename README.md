# cnn_gpu
## Convolution Neural Network models workspace on nvidia_docker

These are python based convolution neural networks configured to run with a custom nvidia-docker instance. 
The Dockerfile was built to run on a System76 Oryx Pro with an Nvidia 1060 gpu and an Intel i7 processor.  Similar setups should probably run it OK, but you may need to make changes to the Dockerfile under keras_src/docker if you experience issues.
